This is a very basic LL(1) grammar parser capable of parsing any context-free grammar it is given.  I have created a grammar file for a language called [Tiny](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1760385.Compiler_Construction) as well as a Tiny example program named grammar.tiny and example.tiny, respectively.  To compile and run the demo, execute the following:

 1. `jsci -o tiny.out grammar.tiny example.tiny`
 2. `./tiny.out`
